I am an international Master student in Mathematics and Physics pursuing a Double Degree between the Technical University of Munich and KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Currently I am also a student research assistent working on the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data using tools from modern mathematics and deep learning in the lab of Antonio Scialdone at the Helmhotz Centre for Environment and Health in Munich. Prior to my Master studies, I completed my Bachelor degree with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Physics at the Technical University of Munich including an exchange term at the National University of Singapore. I expect to complete my studies in fall 2023 and afterwards am looking forward to starting doctoral studies in the group of Matthias Hein at the University of TÃ¼bingen which are funded by the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence.
