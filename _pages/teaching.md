Both during my studies at TU Munich and KTH Stockholm I had the privilege to work as teaching assistant (Tutor/Övningsassistent) for introductory courses in Linear Algebra, Analysis and Numerics. Since I really enjoy communicating mathematics to non-mathematicians, I was mainly involved in courses targeted towards programs with other majors.
