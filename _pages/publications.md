Structural benchmarking for gene regulatory network inference based on single-cell RNA sequencing data
======

In collaboration with Marco Stock, Jonathan Fiorentino and Antonio Scialdone we carried out a benchmarking study on algorithms for the inference of gene regulatory networks with respect to the preservance of topological graph properties as well as the definition and formation of hubs. As a first author I took care the theoretical foundations and carried out the experiments.

Gene regulatory network in- ference from scRNA-seq data by incorporating prior knowledge with graph autoencoders
======
Together with Marco Stock and Antonio Scialdone we have developed a novel algorithm for the inference of gene regulatory networks from single-cell transcriptomic data which is based on graph autoencoders and has a focus computational efficiency. My part of the project was to present the theoretical background and assist the evaluation of the results as well as writing the manuscript.

Interaction Preserving Discretization Methods and Applications in Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data Analysis
======
The projectfor my Bachelor thesis dealt with interaction preserving discretization schemes that were implemented and published in the form of a [Julia package](https://github.com/niclaspopp/MultivariateDiscretization.jl) as well as their application to biological single-cell omics data. The project was supervised by Prof. Dr. Dr. Fabian Theis, Dr. Antonio Scialdone and Dr. Jonathan Fiorentino.


Stochastic gene expression in mammalian cells
======
In 2021 I was granted the DAAD RISE scholarship to carry out a summer internship in the lab of Ramon Grima at the University of Edinburgh and was introduced into the usage of stochastic differential equations for the modelling of gene expression in mammalian cells. The main focus was on computational aspects of model reduction.
